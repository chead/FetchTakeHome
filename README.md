### Steps to Run the App

Select a device and run from Xcode

### Focus Areas: What specific areas of the project did you prioritize? Why did you choose to focus on these areas?

I spent the most time working on the caching via SwiftData because they addressed the core of the performance requirements.

### Time Spent: Approximately how long did you spend working on this project? How did you allocate your time?

I spent approximately 3.5 hours, most of the time focusing on caching and image display but some time for decoding and UX.

### Trade-offs and Decisions: Did you make any significant trade-offs in your approach?

I decided to use SwiftData because it offered on-disk, binary storage. It could be faster using an in-memory only cache but the disk storage preserves the cache between runs.

### Weakest Part of the Project: What do you think is the weakest part of your project?

I could use more testing!
